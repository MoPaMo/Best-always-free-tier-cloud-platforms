**From** developer; **for** developer(s).

This consists of all the reading I did to find **'always' free** cloud platforms **most suitable** for side projects so you and I do not have to pay when unnecessary. The purpose is **not** to *list* relevant **'always' free** services but make the reader aware of **who** is providing them and **where** to read for further information.

## A word of caution

- ***EVERYTHING*** mentioned here is **from my reading** (*links at the bottom*)
- Obviously this is all **an opinion** ~ *not some professional advice*

## What are my (_maybe yours too_) needs and wants?

- Suitable for Node.js Express
- No debit card required (*unless necessary*)
- Be as **vendor free** as possible so migration is relatively straight forward
- As little **Dev Ops** as necessary i.e. *managed Dev Ops*
- Scalable (inc. price) so upgrading to paid services is not crazy 🚀
- Has 'usable enough' domain name i.e. **`myApp`**`.company.app` and not ~~**`myApp1234.sd27s3de.eu-west1`**`.company.app`~~ (_yikes_)

## Eliminating useless choices

### Heroku

- It's perfect.
- Exactly the sort of product I am after.
- Best thing: generous free tier and paid plans not so generous
- Just one issue: Pricing 🚀 when upgrading to paid plans
- Has discontinued its free service!
- Platform as as Service (PaaS)
- [Heroku 'always' free services](https://www.heroku.com/free)

### AWS

- AWS has pretty generous free tier. Unfortunately capped at 12 months.
- Always free services are mostly utilities i.e. not good on their own.
- DynamoDB **always free** `25GB` is exceptional yet it is **vendor locked**
- Lastly it requires debit card
- More of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- [AWS 'always' free services](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=tier%23always-free&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all)

### Azure

- I really want to avoid Microsoft services.
- Just do not like them.

### Google Cloud

- Google's Cloud functions, App engine and Cloud run are generous.
- Yes there is Google's free `f1-micro`. Still its a VM to manage.
- Google cloud is **expensive** in terms of upgrading and is most expensive in relation of AWS and others.
- Lastly it requires debit card
- Mixed services including PaaS and IaaS
- [Google Cloud 'always' free services](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier?hl=fi#free-tier)

### Oracle Cloud

- **Extremely generous** 'always' free tier like 2 VM machine `1GB` RAM each
- It has only **2% market share** ~ this means less people so less answers on `Stackoverflow` and less support
- It is behind competition at least in terms of the big players
- Lastly it requires debit card
- [Oracle Cloud 'always' free services](https://www.oracle.com/uk/cloud/free/#always-free)

## Finding more choices

Heroku is the only **reasonable** option at this point. All other services conflict with the **needs and wants**.

### IBM Cloud

- No debit card required
- **Generous** 'always' free services ~ about **`40`+** of 'always' free services
- [IBM Cloud 'always' free services](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/free) ~ (_you will need to click **always free** tab_)

### Cloudflare workers

- Extremely generous 'always' free tier
- Extremely affordable paid services (_something which Heroku lacks_)
- Free tier has **`10`ms** CPU limit (_sounds trivial yet its decent amount and does not include the time where `app` is waiting for other APIs_)
- No support for Mongodb at the moment (_the only negative! although they are planning on it_)
- No debit card required
- [CloudFlare Workers 'always' free services](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits#worker-limits)
- [CloudFlare Workers 'always' free request limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits#request-limits)
- [CloudFlare Workers 'always' free account plan limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits#account-plan-limits)

### Fly.io

- `3` shared-cpu-1x VMs with 256MB RAM full time.
- `160GB` bandwidth per month (_Google cloud and others cap this usually and no where as generous_)
- 10 active certificates (_in Heroku this is paid service_)
- Super easy to deploy like Heroku CLI
- [Fly.io 'always' free services](https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/#free-tier)

### Other odd choices

These are odd services because they have **generous** 'always' free tier. They are intended for website hosting so their free tier (_which to our interest_) really is mostly cloud functions. These are useful for hosting your web app after your have build your API or depending on needs, it may be more appropriate to skip the API all together and just use provided serverless functions for any backend functionality.

#### Netlify

- `125k` serverless functions every month with no expiry date
- 100GB /month bandwidth
- [Netlify 'always' free services](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) ~ (_you will need to scroll down to see free plans_)

#### Vercel

- Up to 100 GB-Hrs on cloud functions every month with no expiry date
- Serverless function timeout limit to `5` seconds (_in some cases not enough_)
- 100GB /month bandwidth
- [Vercel 'always' free services](https://vercel.com/pricing) ~ (_you will need to scroll down to see free plans_)
- [Vercel 'always' free general limits](https://vercel.com/docs/platform/limits#general-limits)

## Ideal choice

### Fly.io

- Is like Heroku. Just a lot more affordable
- For example (_for surface level comparison_):
  - `1GB` shared cpu is **$0.0000022/s ($5.70/mo)** (_In Heroku, `1GB` it is **$50 per month**_)
  - 1 dedicated 2GB is **$0.0000120/s ($31.00/mo)** (_In Heroku, `2GB` it is **$100 per month**_)

### Cloudflare workers (_in future_)

- Super fast and it is **100,000 requests per day** (_yes, per day!_)
- Once it supports **Mongodb** and possibly the ability to run **Node.js express.js** although `express.js` can be done by other means too
